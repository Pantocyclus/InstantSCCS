### Useful IotMs

If you're looking to modify the script yourself, you may also consider these useful IotMs. Any IotM that grants access to a scaler zone helps save a pull on the daypass, which may then be used on other useful pulls (e.g. [non-Euclidean angle](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Non-Euclidean_angle) or [SPF 451 lip balm](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/SPF_451_lip_balm)).<br/>
Once you start getting more and more [free fight sources](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Free_Fights), the less reliant you will be on the [trainset](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Model_train_set) and [bowling ball](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Cosmic_bowling_ball) for xp (they may be swapped out). Shinies that reduce turncount on the tests will then reduce the reliance on the [cookbookbat](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Cookbookbat) for turngen.<br/>
<sub><sup>Note that the various IotMs may have turnsaves in the same area, so having access to a bunch of them would result in fewer turns saved than the naive sum of the estimates listed here.</sup></sub><br/>

<sub><sup>Note that the base route grabs [cookbookbat](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Cookbookbat) ingredients 6 times while the other routes only grab it 5 times (which results in one less epic food turngen from the [Pete's wiley whey bar](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Pete%27s_wiley_whey_bar))</sup></sub><br/>
\*Enables alternative routing that potentially saves another ~11 turns.<br/>
\*\*The [Fourth of May Cosplay Saber](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Fourth_of_May_Cosplay_Saber) combos really well with the [industrial fire extinguisher](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Industrial_fire_extinguisher), saving an additional ~35 turns (from [Fireproof Foam Suit](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Fireproof_Foam_Suit)).<br/>
It also enables the [Pocket Meteor Guide](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Pocket_Meteor_Guide) in saving an additional ~16 turns on the wdmg, sdmg and famwt tests.<br/>
Both benefit from an additional +4 turns saved in enabling [cowrruption](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Cowrruption) to be carried over to the sdmg test.<br/>
<sub><sup>This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and the turns saved are only relevant to this particular route. There are many other strong IotMs, including [corked genie bottle](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Corked_genie_bottle), [Pack of Every Card](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Pack_of_Every_Card), [Source terminal](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Source_terminal), [Witchess Set](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Witchess_Set) and [suspicious package](https://wiki.kingdomofloathing.com/Suspicious_package) just to name a few.</sup></sub><br/>

### Highly-Recommended Resources

Merely satisfying the necessary requirements likely leaves you miles away from being able to complete a one-day run. Because we do not rely heavily on too many IotMs to carry us through the SCCS run, you are highly recommended to have the following bunch of skills and familiars to enable this run. The small +stat% buffs matter a lot for the offstat tests, and each of these resources will save 1 or more turns in your run. <br/>

If you're missing any of the skills, do take a look at the list of supported IotMs to see if said IotMs can make up for the deficiencies. <br/>

### Other Recommendations

You are also strongly recommended to have the following resources. However, unlike the resources above, none of them provide much turngen/turn savings individually (although together they do make up quite a bit), and these may also be easily replaced with more shinies.<br/>
